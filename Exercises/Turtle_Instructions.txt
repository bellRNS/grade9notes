From Allan Downey - Think Python 2e.

The following is a series of exercises using TurtleWorld. They are meant to be fun, but they have a point, too. While you are working on them, think about what the point is.

The following sections have solutions to the exercises. We will go over them together.

1. 
Write a function called square that takes a parameter named t, which is a turtle. It should use the turtle to draw a square.

**Write a function call that passes bob as an argument to square, and then run the program again.**

2.
Add another parameter, named length, to square. Modify the body so length of the sides is length, and then modify the function call to provide a second argument. Run the program again. Test your program with a range of values for length.

3. 
Make a copy of square and change the name to polygon. Add another parameter named n and modify the body so it draws an n-sided regular polygon. Hint: The exterior angles of an n-sided regular polygon are 360/n degrees.

4.
Write a function called circle that takes a turtle, t, and radius, r, as parameters and that draws an approximate circle by calling polygon with an appropriate length and number of sides. Test your function with a range of values of r.
Hint: figure out the circumference of the circle and make sure that length * n = circumference.
