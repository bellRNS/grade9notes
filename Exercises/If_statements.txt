IF Statement Exercises 

Level 1-3

Tree
Write a for loop that makes seven calls to print() to output the following triangle:

#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######

Level 4-5

Beans
You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing "string"[N]. 
The returned value will be a string containing only one character (for example, "b"). 
The first character has position 0, which causes the last one to be found at 
position string.length - 1. 
In other words, a two-character string has length 2, and its characters have positions 0 and 1.

Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number that 
indicates how many uppercase “B” characters there are in the string.
Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, 
except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to
 be counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters). 
Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.


Level 6-7

FizzBuzz
Write a program that uses print() to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions.
For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 
(and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers 
that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers
 divisible by only one of those).
(This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed
 out a significant percentage of programmer candidates. 
So if you solved it, your labor market value just went up.)
