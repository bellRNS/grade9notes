We watched the documentary RAMS in preparation for our Christmas Project. 

Here we learned about Rams' 10 principles of Good Design. 


1. Good design is innovative. 

2. Good design makes a product useful. 

3. Good design is aesthetic. 

4. Good design makes a product understandable. 

5. Good design is unobtrusive.

6. Good design is honest. 

7. Good design is long-lasting. 

8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail. 

9. Good design is environmentally friendly. 

10. Good design is as little design as possible. 

We then worked through Design Thinking Practices. See the PDF attached for note # 11.
