*** Assignment 3 - Command Line Game/Help Tool ***

Your task for this assignment will to be to develop a command line style
game. This will be very similar to our 'check_in_bot' that we created in 
class. 

You must create a game/tool that contains IF statements. Examples of this may
be: 
-A Dungeon Game (choose your fate at each turn)
-A diagnostic tool (is your refrigerator operating properly?)
-An artificial chat bot (someone to soothe our emotions, like the check_in example)
-Anything you can think of (as long as you get it approved)

You must create something that you think is valuable or fun. 

Please do not do the bare minimum on this project. It sounds easy enough, but you 
must try to make it as interesting and helpful as possible. 

You will be marked as follows: 

1 - Your game/tool can not be run by python, and shows little to no effort.

2 - Your game tool is simple but has errors. You have fewer than 4 'nodes'

3 - Your game/tool is simple and runs (no errors). You have 5 or more 'nodes'

4 - Your game/tool is simple, runs, has more than 5 'nodes' and has modular functions
defined (see below for example).

5 - A 4 + has more than 10 'nodes'

6 - A 5 + You incorporated sound and images into your game.

7 - You used an artificial intelligence to create an elaborate and fantastical 
outcome. Example here: https://play.aidungeon.io/main/landing


*** Assignment 3  - END ***


Appendix: notes on modular functions 

if x == 4: 
	print(hello!)
	return x + 5


VERSUS 
def turn_1():
	print(hello!)
	return x + 5


if x == 4: 
	turn_1()


Essentially, your game code will look very tidy, and your functions will be defined at the 
top of the page (We will discuss this during class time)
