Step 1

Read the link here for the assignment rubric 
(https://github.com/bellRNS/grade9notes/blob/master/Assignments/Christmas%20Project%20.txt). 
You will notice that there isn't a lot of direction, and that's by design! I want you to come up with something that speaks to you, not our requirements.

Step 2 

Find your partner for the assignment at the bottom of the project rubric. I chose the partners to maximize our project outputs this time. Remember that we are an inclusive 
class and there is no reason to not like your partner. 

Step 3

Identify WHO your Christmas toy is for. 
Is it for young kids? Kids with extra developmental needs? Older kids? Sporty kids? 
Use the first page of the link here 
(https://github.com/bellRNS/grade9notes/blob/master/Notes/11.%20Design%20Deck.pdf)
to 'empathize' with the toy user. Consider what the person you are designing for will want. 
YOU MUST WRITE THIS DOWN, either with paper and pencil or on a doc.

Step 4 

On the second page of this link 
(https://github.com/bellRNS/grade9notes/blob/master/Notes/11.%20Design%20Deck.pdf)
you must fill in the blanks " _______ needs ______ because_______. "
What are some things your user will need? Be sure to be thinking in the shoes of the user. 

Step 5 

Write down your "How Might We..." as defining your problem. 
Example 1: "How might we design an engaging toy for a 6 year old with vision problems?"
Example 2: "How might we make a toy that teaches 4 year olds about pattern repetition?"

Step 6

THE MOST FUN PART OF THE DAY. 
On a blank piece of paper divide your page into 8 equal squares (much like the last slide of the design deck).
Set a timer on your phone/device for 40 seconds. 
You have 40 seconds to come up with a unique solution to your 'How Might We..' question. 
After 40 seconds you MUST move to the next square. 
This will happen 8 times. It will feel crappy after 4 squares, but your final two will 
most likely be your best ones, so keep pushing! 

Step 7

Combine your ideas together and chat about how to proceed. Give positive feedback to 
each other, and pick 2-3 ideas that work for your team. 

Step 8

Submit a project proposal for the Christmas Project. It will include: 
-Your user definition from Step 3
-Your 'how might we' sentence from Step 5 
-Your best idea from the group from Step 7 
-How you plan on incorporating your skills from this class 
-What physical components you will need 
-A project class by class timeline of what you will complete.
