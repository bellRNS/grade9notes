**** TURTLES ASSIGNMENT ****

We have used the turtle package to draw some shapes and letters. 

We have used for loops to help create these shapes efficiently.

We also generalized to use any turtle for each function!  

Your assignment will be graded based on levels. 

Level 1 
Create a function called square() that draws a simple square using turtles.

Level 2 
Create function called multi_squares(n) that takes a parameter 'n' that allows you to draw multiple squares in a row. 'n' will be the number of squares.(Same place or multiple locations is fine)

Level 3 
Create a function called any_shape(s) that draws a polygon where 's' is the number of sides.

Level 4 
Create a function for each 10 letters of the alphabet. Example, letter_w() draws a W. 

Level 5 
Create a function each letter of the alphabet. 

Level 6 
Create a function that takes a string parameter that draws out someones name. Example, draw_name('jeff') draws out J E F F on turtle world.

Level 7 
Add colour to your answer from level 6. Each time the turtle's pen is down, it should be a different color!
