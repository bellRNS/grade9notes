Notes for September 14 

We discussed the toast continuum. 

First, we did GitHub accounts and downloads. 

Then we opened IDLE, and created a text file for notes. 

Python has really simple language. 

I can use python as a calculator 
Examples: 
>>> 10 + 10
20

>>>19 * 18
342 

calculator python settings we have OPERATORS 
 + is plus or add 
 - is subtract 
 * is multiply 
 / is divide 
 ** is a power 

(bonus, square root is the same as fraction power).
example of this 4**(1/2) = 2
